# Benchmark results

The homepage chart uses the archived run recorded on **August 30, 2026**. It is
not a measurement of the latest release. Use these numbers to understand this
workload, then benchmark your own project before drawing broader conclusions.

![Median CLI time: utoo-lint 9.52 ms, Oxlint 35.78 ms, Biome 47.38 ms, ESLint 742.05 ms. Lower is better.](/benchmarks/comparison-en.svg)

| Tool | Median wall-clock time |
| --- | ---: |
| utoo-lint | 9.52 ms |
| Oxlint | 35.78 ms |
| Biome | 47.38 ms |
| ESLint | 742.05 ms |

The image uses a **linear scale starting at zero**. The table rounds the original
measurements to two decimal places; the downloadable data retains all samples.

## What was measured

- **Corpus:** 100 generated TypeScript files, with no intentional diagnostics.
- **Rules:** the same 12 shared rules for every tool.
- **Sampling:** 5 warmups, followed by 20 measured runs per tool.
- **Runtime:** macOS arm64, Node.js 20.19.1.
- **Timing:** wall-clock time for a fresh CLI process, including startup.

The snapshot records the commands and every timing sample. It does **not** record
CPU model or the exact linter versions, so it cannot support version-specific or
hardware-independent claims. Daemon reuse, caches, editor integrations, and
ESLint rules requiring type information are outside this comparison.

## Inspect or reproduce

[Download the complete measurement snapshot](/benchmarks/2026-08-30.json).
The [benchmark suite](https://github.com/utooland/utoo-lint/tree/main/benchmarks)
contains the corpus generator, shared-rule mapping, and runner. From a checkout
with the development prerequisites installed:

```bash
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast
pnpm --dir benchmarks install
pnpm bench:generate -- --files=100
pnpm bench -- --runs=20 --warmups=5
```

This produces a **new** measurement using your local binary and installed tool
versions; it will not reproduce the archived times exactly. Compare tools using
the same machine, corpus, and rule set.
